# Reproducible Figures Assignment

This project aimed to assess the relationship between culmen length and body mass in the Palmer Penguins data set. 

This folder contains all of the files to run the MT24 reproducible figures assignment. There are two options to run this: using Reproducible_figures_assignment_Q2.qmd, which was uploaded for my partner for Q3 to view before I'd made the final file with the answers to all of the questions, and using Reproducible_figures_assignment_full.qmd, which contains my answers to all of the questions.

To install the project, download all files and unzip. Open the reproducibleFigures R project first. Then, within it open Reproducible_figures_assignment_Q2.full- this file contains the data pipeline and answers to all of the questions. 

Before running the pipeline, do renv::restore() in the console to install the correct version of the packages used.
