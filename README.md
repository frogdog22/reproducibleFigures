# Reproducible Figures Assignment

This project aimed to assess the relationship between culmen length and body mass in the Palmer Penguins data set. 

This folder contains all of the files to run question 2 of the MT24 reproducible figures assignment. 

To install the project, download all files and unzip. Open the reproducibleFigures R project first. Then, within it open Reproducible_figures_assignment_Q2.qmd - this file contains the data pipeline. 

Before running the pipeline, do renv::restore() in the console to install the correct version of the packages used.
